## Introduction

This website will detail my **second** workterm experience at System1. This website will be broken down into 4 parts:

- Job description
- Goals
- What I learned
- Conclusion


## Job Description
In my role, I handle a range of technical tasks, including working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Jinja, and YAML files. I pick up or am assigned tasks using Jira tickets. These tasks may include building new sites, implementing new site features, or updating the existing codebase. I also develop and utilize internal Python tools to streamline the site-building process.


## Goals
I have created 3 goals this term:
- Improve Communication and Collaboration Skills
- Improve Site Build Process
- Run a Search Release

By the end of this work term, I have successfully achieved the goals I set for myself. I improved my communication and collaboration skills by stepping out of my comfort zoneâ€”writing professional emails, engaging with coworkers through Slack and in person, attending company events, and building meaningful connections. I improved the site-build process by developing and implementing a streamlined approach for integrating shopping pages. Unlike my first term, I took on the responsibility of running multiple search releases with support from my team members.


## What I Learned
This term was about solidifying my skills at System1. I improved my coding abilities, communication, and time management. With each passing day, I became more efficient and effective at completing my tasks.

Throughout the term, I worked with Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. As a result, my understanding of these languages has grown significantly from where I first started.

When work was slow, or I had completed my tasks, I used this opportunity to learn new skills. System1 has provided free access to online learning through platforms such as LinkedIn Learning and Frontend Masters. Over my term, I have spent my free time learning React and Node. 

Other than the technical skills, I learned that it is ok to ask questions when I need to. I learned that I am not expected to know everything. I learned that working as a software developer isn't as scary as I made it out to be. Most importantly, I learned how inspiring and supportive people in this industry can be. There are some fantastic people I have met who are willing to guide you through challenging situations and engage in insightful and meaningful conversations.


## Conclusion 
I came out of this work term with much more knowledge under my belt. I have significantly deepened my skills in Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I now have a clearer image of what it is like working as a software engineer and what is expected of me in this role. My employer has expressed great satisfaction with my contributions and has extended an offer for me to return in the future. I am more than confident stepping into work term three.
