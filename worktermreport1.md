This website will detail my experience during my summer work term at System1. I'll discuss the goals I set, whether I achieved them or not, provide an overview of the work I did, and share any interesting experiences from this term.

In my role, I handle a range of technical tasks, including working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Jinja and YAML files. I pick up or I am assigned Jira tickets - these tickets typically include projects like building new sites, implementing new site features, or updating the existing codebase. I also develop and utilize internal Python tools to streamline the processes of site building and configuration.

# GOALS

I have created 5 goals this term. These goals include:
1. **Become a valuable member to the team**
By asking relevant questions, suggesting changes, and solving problems as a team
2. **Become competent creating and releasing code**
By learning the build/deploy process 
3. **Improve my time management skills**
By managing deadlines, and allocating resources efficiently
4. **Become proficient in using company tools**
By learning how to operate these tools, asking questions and taking classes
5. **Running a search release**
By reading through the documentation and coordinating with team members through the release.

By the end of my first work term - whether it be through reading documentation, asking questions, completing courses, or hands-on experience - I have successfully completed most of my goals. The one goal I didn't accomplish was running a search release. Luckily, I have already spoken with my managers about this, and we are planning on getting a search release out early in the next term. Also, although my time management has improved greatly over this last term, it could always be better, and I can continue learning and implementing healthier habits.

Although there are many System1 employees in Canada, and I work from the Guelph office every Tuesday and Thursday, most of my team, management, and the colleagues I interact with are based in California or Washington state. This arrangement is quite unique, even by System1 standards, as none of my coworkers or fellow co-op students in the office have a similar setup. This creates an interesting dynamic, as I start my workday three hours before my team and finish three hours earlier due to the time difference. Because of this, I need to plan carefully at the end of each day — reviewing the tickets I want to tackle the next morning and ensuring I fully understand them before signing off. Without this preparation, I risk being unable to work for the first three hours of my day. Despite these challenges, we’ve managed to adapt and continue working smoothly, as if the time difference didn’t exist.

# Conclusion
I came out of this work term with much more knowledge under my belt. I've significantly deepened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have even begun learning React. I'm excited to have the opportunity to return to System1 for the Fall term, where I hope to gain more experience with backend development. Although these tasks didn't come up too often, I had lots of fun creating/revamping tools with Python. Moving forward, I aim to explore the codebase to identify areas of improvement and make meaningful contributions for future developers.
