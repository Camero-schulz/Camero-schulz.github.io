      <h2>What We Thought Dreams Were</h2>
      <p>Dreaming remains one of the most mysterious aspects of sleep. Across many cultures and people,
        dreams can mean many different things, yet, interestingly, they also echo the exact same thing.

        For the <strong>Ancient Egyptians</strong>, the dream world was what
        existed between the living and the dead. When one enters a dream, the Egyptians thought they
        were communicating with the dead. You would then have to interpret the dream to understand what
        the dream entities were trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Ancient Hebrews</strong> believed that sleep was the veil
        between the living and the world of angels, spirits and demons. Sometimes, God himself would speak through
        dreams. Those who would follow the Old Testament viewed dreams as divine wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Native Americans</strong> believed that dreams were it's own seperate dimension where you could interact with a 
        universal consciousness. There was knowledge to be learnt from the spirits and animals that accompany it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through all of these different cultures, there exists a common experience that considers the dream space
        as a sacred realm. Where the messages given to them by higher orders, are not to be overlooked, but cherished and integrated
        in every day life.

      <h2>The Real Reason</h2>
      <h3>Why Do We Sleep?</h3>
      <p>Although there are a lot of unknowns to why we sleep. From what we
        understand, sleep serves multiple purposes rather than a single function. Over
        the years, scientists have proposed numerous theories to explain the phenomenon of  
        sleep. These theories encompass various ideas, including:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Energy Conservation</strong> - Sleeping just 8 hours can conserve
          up to 35% of caloric needs. </li>
          <li><strong>Cellular Restoration</strong> - Sleep allows cells to repair and grow.</li>
          <li><strong>Brain Function</strong> - Lack of sleep negatively effects memory and
          problem-solving abilities. Sleep is also useful for converting short-term 
          memories into long-turn memories. Not getting enough sleep could potentially result 
          in lasting brain damage. </li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Stability</strong> - While sleeping, brain activity increases
          in areas that regulate mood - mainly the amygdala. When sleep-deprived, the 
          amygdala is more likely to overreact in stressful situations. A lack of sleep is 
          linked to numerous mental health problems, including, depression, anxiety and paranoia</li>
          <li><strong>Healthy Immunity</strong> - Improper sleep can weaken the immune
          system and make you more susceptible to germs.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Why Do We Dream?</h3>
      <img src="images/sig.webp" class="right-pic">
      <p> Dreaming is a little more complicated.
        The truth is, even after years of research and scientifc innovation, 
        no one really knows why we dream. Although numerous theories have 
        been proposed, none have provided conclusive explanations. These theories 
        encompass various ideas. </p>
      <p>
        Sigmund Freud regarded dreams as the road to the unconcious mind. According
        to Freud, dreams occur due to "stimuli from the external world, subjective 
        experiences, organic stimuli within the body, and mental activities during sleep".
        He believed that the connections the dream makes is not random, but rather, 
        one's unconcious desires. The goal of the dream is to interpret and reveal
        what it truly means, no matter how pleasent or unpleasent the dream is. 
      </p>

      <p>
        More modern theories suggest that dreams could have other meanings. Maybe dreams
        help aid in memory function. Maybe they exist to make us more creative. Maybe 
        we dream to help us prepare and protect for the worst.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the most believed reason why we dream is due to how our brains process memories.
        While sleeping, our brain is busy strengthening connections and converting short-term memory
        into long-term memory. As the theory goes, while completing these tasks, our brain sends 
        electrical signals that gets detected by our conscious brain. Our consciousness doesn't 
        understand what the signals means, trys to fill in the gaps the best it can, and the next 
        thing we know, we're dreaming.
